- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ali11101
- ðŸ‘€ I recently started web development, and I don't know much about it but I'm learning something new day by day.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS but I find it a bit difficult and time consuming, so I've been considering moving to a framework or a UI kit for my projects.
- I'll be looking forward to posting on github and I hope that in the near fututre I'm able to create my own repository, from scratch.
